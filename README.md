# Product Vision

For the player who wants a game that can be continously challenging and replayable, the product is a 2D dungeon crawler that offers a unique experience for each person by adapting to their needs. Unlike the traditional dungeon crawler that uses either pre-made or purely random levels, our product offers continuous gameplay that will be generated based on the user's playstyle.

The game will keep track of both long and short-term player statistics and decisions as inputs. These will be sent to an algorithm that will output different types of enemy generation (such as type, difficulty, and frequency). Room designs will be modular and pre-made; each room will have preset spawnpoints for enemies and obstacles. While the rooms that make up a level will be randomly chosen, the interactable entities within such as treasure, enemies, and obstacles will be determined by the AI. Enemies will adapt to the player, and the player will respond in turn to create an ever-evolving game.
